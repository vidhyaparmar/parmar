<font size="5" color="#CF5C3F"><b>Q.3</b> What is image map?</font>
<p>
<b>Ans:-</b>
<font size="5" color="CF5C3F">Image Map</font> -: An image map is an image that contains many hot spots that may result<br>
in a different URL being loading depending on where the user clicks. 
</p>
<font size="4" color="CF5C3F">1) Client Side Image Map</font>:- In Client Side image map we put the map coding in the head or body</br>
   section of html file. So in client side image map there is only one file for map information and html coding
<p><font size="4" color="CF5C3F">2) Server-side Image Map</font>-: In Server-Side image map we put the map coding in separate file,whose file </br>
extension is .map. and make reference of this map file in html file.So in server side image map there are 2</br> 
separate file,one for map information and other for html code, where img tag uses the map file information
</p>
<font size="5" color="CF5C3F"><b>Q.4</b>What is cellspadding and cellspacing?</font>
<p>
<b>Ans:-</b>
It’s possible to change the amount of padding within a table’s cells, as well as the spacing between all<br> 
the cells in a table. This is done with the cellpadding and cellspacing attributes, respectively. In the border<br>
 rather extreme example that follows, cellpadding is set to 20, cellspacing to 40, and to 5, so that each can be <br>
differentiated with ease (see the subsequent screenshot). As you can see, cellspacing not only affects the spacing <br>
between the cells, but also the distance between the cells and the table’s edges. <br>
